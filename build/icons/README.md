# React Security Suite Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files for the extension:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels

## Icon Design Guidelines

The icons should follow these design guidelines:

1. Use a shield or lock symbol to represent security
2. Use React's logo or atom symbol to represent React
3. Use a blue color scheme for defense mode
4. Use an orange/red accent for training mode
5. Keep the design simple and recognizable at small sizes

## Placeholder Icons

Until you create custom icons, you can use placeholder icons:

1. Visit [https://favicon.io/](https://favicon.io/) to generate simple icons
2. Or use React's logo with a shield overlay
3. Or create simple SVG icons and export them as PNG files

## Icon Usage in the Extension

These icons are used in the following places:

- Browser toolbar icon (16px, 48px depending on display density)
- Extension management page (48px)
- Chrome Web Store listing (128px)
- Firefox Add-ons listing (128px)

Make sure all icons are in PNG format with transparency where appropriate.
